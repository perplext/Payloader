Payloader is simply a script that builds Meterpreter or SET
payloads for you in all formats with the desired settings.
Its intent is for when you are trying to write an exploit
in a variety of languages, or you will be modifying a 
variety of exploits to use the same payload (ie. reverse
tcp back to the attacking machine in CTFs).
